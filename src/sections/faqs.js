                  platform that will allow you to make design requests and keep
                  track of progress. At this point we&#x27;ll jump on a welcome
                  call and I can take you through the platform and answer any

                  All the designs are done by one person, me! This means no
                  out-sourcing and no freelancers. I may call on specialists
                  from time to time, for example if the project requires some
                  wonderful animation, but for everything else you can be
                  guaranteed that I will be working on your project.

                  Yes, once you are happy with the designs and everything&#x27;s
                  fully signed off I&#x27;ll pass the source files over to you.

                  There will never be any surprise hidden costs. If a project
                  requires specific specialist support, for example animation or
                  web development then there would be additional cost, but this
                  would be discussed with you first, and only once I have your
                  consent will I proceed. Everything from fonts to images will
                  be free and included in your package.
